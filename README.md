## snmp powershell

Having problems finding a nice lightweight program to run in windows to search down those pesky mac addresses?

This uses powershell to start a small snmp walker app (someone else's - I can't take the credit) and process the output

Has much room for improvmement, has been designed for a specific purpose, but now that the hardware is done, can be retrofitted for other search and rescue styles
